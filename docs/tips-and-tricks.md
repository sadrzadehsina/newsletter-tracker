### 🏷️ Strategic Label Usage

#### Label Hierarchy
```
📊 Status Labels (mutually exclusive):
├── to-read (default for new articles)
├── reading (actively reading)
├── completed (finished)
└── archived (reference only)

🏷️ Category Labels (can combine):
├── tech, business, personal
├── ai, startups, finance
└── productivity, learning

📮 Source Labels:
├── morning-brew, hacker-news
├── medium, substack
└── newsletter-name

⚡ Priority/Effort Labels:
