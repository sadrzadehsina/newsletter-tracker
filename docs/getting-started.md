## 📚 Daily Workflow

### 🌅 Morning (5 minutes)
1. **Scan your newsletters** (don't read everything)
2. **Save interesting articles** using the issue template
3. **Add quick labels** (category + priority)
4. **Estimate reading time**

### 🕐 Reading Time (15-30 minutes)
1. **Filter by available time:**
   - Short break: [Quick reads](../../issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:quick-read)
   - Lunch: [Medium reads](../../issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:medium-read)
   - Evening: [Long reads](../../issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:long-read)

2. **Choose by priority:**
   - [High priority](../../issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:high-priority) first
   - [Regular articles](../../issues?q=is:issue+is:open+-label:high-priority) when time allows

3. **Read actively:**
   - Add comments while reading
   - Note key insights
   - Identify action items

4. **Close when done:**
   - Mark issue as complete
   - System tracks your progress

### 🌙 Weekly Review (10 minutes)
1. **Check your stats** on the dashboard
2. **Review completed articles** for insights
3. **Clean up old "reading" labels**
4. **Plan next week's focus**

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### Start Small
- **Week 1:** Just save articles, don't worry about perfect organization
- **Week 2:** Add basic labels (category only)
- **Week 3:** Start taking notes in comments
- **Week 4:** Use priority labels and collections

### Be Consistent
- **Same time daily:** Set aside 15 minutes for reading
- **Same process:** Always use templates and labels
- **Same device:** Use mobile for saving, computer for deep reading

### Focus on Quality
- **Better to read 3 articles well** than skim 10 poorly
- **Take notes while reading,** not just after
- **Close issues when done** to maintain clean queue

### Use Automation
- **Let GitHub Actions** handle routine tasks
- **Set up mobile shortcuts** for quick saving
- **Use search filters** instead of manual browsing

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "I have too many unread articles"
**Solution:** Be more selective in saving. Only save articles you're genuinely likely to read.

### "I forget to take notes"
**Solution:** Set a rule - no closing issues without at least one comment.

### "My labels are inconsistent"
**Solution:** Use the auto-labeling feature and stick to the suggested label set.

### "I don't know what to read first"
**Solution:** Use priority labels and time-based filtering. Start with high-priority quick reads.
